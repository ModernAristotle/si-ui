                            District Executive
                            (iii) State Level State Council State Executive

                            (b) The National Executive of the Party in consultation with respective State Executives may sub-divide a state into two or more regions for functional
                            or administrative convenience by constituting regional Councils and Executives for each such regions of
                            the state. The provisions of this Constitution applicable to state level Councils and
                            Executives will apply to such regional organs, mutatis mutandis.
                            (c) The Party’s organs may be organized at Taluka, Tehsil, Mandal, Assembly Constituency, or other administrative level below District level suitable
                            for that state instead of at the Block level as deemed fit by the concerned State Executive. Powers and functions of such units will be identical to

                            intermediate levels as defined by that State Executive between State level and District level, between District level and Block level, and below Block
                            level for functional or administrative convenience in that state. The composition, hierarchy, powers and functions of such urban and intermediate level
                            bodies shall be as specified by the concerned State Executive. However, if any such units are proposed to be constituted in substitution of rather than
                            in addition to District level units of the Party as specified in this Constitution, they will be constituted only on the basis of direct election by
                            Party members in that region. Further, any such substitution shall require ratification by the National Executive.
                            (e) State Executives will exercise their powers to restructure Party Organs below state level under the direction and superintendence of the National
                            Executive.
                            (f) Areas of District Units will ordinarily be the same as those of respective Administrative Revenue Districts in the State. Areas of State Units of
                            the Party will conform to the States and Union Territories mentioned in the Constitution of India. If a state has been subdivided into Regions,
